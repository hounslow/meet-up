# Meet Up

## About
This app was built in my 2nd year of computer science. It is an Android app built using Java. The concept revolves around displaying a map of campus, with certain destinations shown as X marks on the map. You can also see your location, and can click on any destination to then draw a line showing how you can get there. You can also potentially see someone else's schedule, so that you can organize meet ups with them at times that work for both you and the other person.

## Running this app
In order to run this app, I had to have an emulator for an android device, a long with an IDE called Eclipse that then ran this app and communicated with my emulator. As of right now, the key I used for this API no longer exists.
